			<h2>What is it?</h2>
			<pre>
<b>BoD Sampler</b> is a small program to quickly play a small sound clip ("sample", or "jingle") from a collection.
You can use it for example at the office to play funny sounds in accordance to what your coworkers say or do.
For example somebody has a difficult task to do: play the "mission impossible" sample. Hilarity will ensue.
To my knowlege, it has no other use besides being fun.

In an environment where only one PC has a soundcard or speakers, but everybody wants to be able to play samples, BoD Sampler can be used:
it has a client/server architecture. The server runs on the PC that can play sounds, and several clients can run on the other PCs.
When somebody click on a sample on the client application, a network command is sent to the server application, which will play the sample.
