    <h2>
      What's this and why is it called "3615 JRAF"?
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is my (Benoit Lubek, aka BoD) personal website. It's called <b>3615 JRAF</b> as a reference to the Minitel, a device and online
      service
      that was popular in France in the 80s and 90s. The Minitel worked by dialing a special phone number, <b>3615</b> (pronounced
      "trente-six quinze"), and entering the name of the service to access.<br>
      <br>
      The Minitel was a precursor to the Web, and was used for things like chat, games, and online shopping. Read all about it
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website uses an <a href="https://github.com/Zigazou/miedit" target="_blank">emulator</a> so you can experience
      exactly how it is on the real thing.<br>
      <br>
      Yes it is slow :) but in a way, that's the point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh and "JRAF" is just the domain name I've been using. It's kind of a pun on the word "giraffe" (my favorite animal) as it's
      pronounced the same in French.
    </p>

    <p>
      Have fun!
